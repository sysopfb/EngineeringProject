Engineering Project
==========

The project is divided into two levels, the second level simply adding to the difficulty of the first one. Perform the minimum level for the position sought but feel free to perform the other level if you so desire.

Software Engineering Intern or Jr. Software Engineer
-------------

Using [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) create an application that retrieves magic cards from a database and displays the following information on the screen:

* The card graphic.
* The card name.
* The card flavor text.
* Any other fields you feel would make your application stand out from the others.

If you are seeking this level, a flask skeleton application will be provided for you but you must make it actually return the data that you need from the search parameters sent by the user.

The information must be pulled from the flask backend using jQuery and AJAX and the DOM must be built using jQuery.

Software Engineer
-------------

Building on the Intern / Jr. Engineer project, we will give you a website that you can obtain data from programatically using a “scrape”. You will be required to build the database of Magic cards.

We will provide SQLAlchemy models and instructions on how to read and write data using them. The flask backend will not be provided for this level and must be built entirely by you. We will provide the database and SQLAlchemy models along with examples of how to access data using them.

This will also give you a schema to work with for your scrape.
